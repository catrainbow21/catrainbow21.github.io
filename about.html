    <h1>About</h1>
	  <p>I am currently working towards my <i>associate degree in software development</i> as a stepping stone towards getting my bachelorâ€™s degree in software engineering. I am currently in my <u>2nd semester</u> at the <i>College of Western Idaho</i> and am taking my first class in the <i>software development course</i>.</p>
    <h2>Career Goals</h2>
    <p>My career goal by the end of my time at the <i>College of Western Idaho</i> is to intern and eventually work as a software engineer for <i>Schweitzer Engineering Laboratories</i>, where my dad has worked in the same position for many years. I intend to attend university at either <i>Boise State University</i> or <i>University of Idaho</i>.</p>
    <h3>Skills & Abilities</h3>
    <p>I am a <strong>fast learner, a skilled worker, and a creative thinker</strong>. I enjoy both <strong>creative</strong> and <strong>logistical</strong> work. I like to be able to bring new ideas to a project and <em>make things fun and interesting</em>, but I also enjoy keeping things <em>organized and neat</em>. I tend to enjoy work that most others would find <b>tedious</b>, and problems that <i>make me think</i>.</p>
